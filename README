BONUS PART:

In my game i can overcome checkmate by moving a different piece, not only the king itself.

I do this like that:
 If in the beginning of the turn my king was threatened (check) ill also check in the
 end of the turn if my king is still in threat by a different colored pieces on the table
 (it is a check im doing in the end of every turn), and if he is i cancel this input,
 and ask for a different one. if i killed the threat or used another piece of mine as
 a divider between the threat to my king, so when ill check if my king is in risk ill
 get a negative answer.
